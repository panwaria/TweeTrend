Parser parses linearly ==> linear in the number of movies

Creating taxonomy tree ==> 3 x number of movies

Creating MovieCast XML ==> 5 x number of movies
Reading from XML:
Parser parses linearly ==> linear in the number of casts (5 x N)
Creating trie ==> max_length_name x number of casts = 20 x 5 x N
